# Development Log

This file tracks noteworthy experiments, fixes, and decisions shared between Codex and Claude while working on FinRL.

## How to Update
- Append the newest entry at the top of the log to keep recent context visible.
- Include date, agent (Codex or Claude), and a concise summary of actions, results, and next steps.
- Link to relevant artifacts (commit SHAs, notebooks, trained models, tensorboard runs) instead of inlining large outputs.
- Avoid rewriting or deleting past entries; add a short follow-up note if something is superseded.

## Template
```
### YYYY-MM-DD â€“ Agent Name
- Context: short description of what triggered the work.
- Actions: bullet list of commands/code touched.
- Results: metrics, observations, or links to saved artifacts.
- Next Steps: optional reminders or open questions.
```
