# Feature Specification: SPY RL Trading System

**Feature Branch**: `1-spy-rl-trading`
**Created**: 2025-10-27
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "build a comprehensive RL trading system using finRL framework with the following setups: market:stock, symbol: spy, timeframe: daily, 2020-2025, reward: log-return, action space: discrete (buy, hold, sell)"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Quantitative Researcher Training and Validating SPY Trading Strategies (Priority: P1)

A quantitative researcher wants to develop and validate a reinforcement learning trading strategy for SPY
(S&P 500 ETF) using historical daily price data. The researcher needs to train an agent on 2020-2025
historical data to learn optimal trading decisions based on price movements and technical indicators.
The system should provide clear feedback on agent performance through reward signals based on log returns.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition—enabling RL-based strategy development with
historical backtesting. Without this, the system has no demonstrable capability.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by: (1) Loading SPY daily data for 2020-2025, (2) Training an
agent using a discrete action space (buy/hold/sell), (3) Observing converging reward signal (log returns),
(4) Validating learned policy captures market trends.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** historical SPY daily OHLCV data for 2020-2025, **When** agent trains for N episodes,
   **Then** agent achieves cumulative log-return >0 (profitable on training set)

2. **Given** a trained agent, **When** system evaluates actions at each trading day,
   **Then** each action (buy/hold/sell) receives a log-return reward signal

3. **Given** multiple training runs, **When** agent initializations vary (random seed changes),
   **Then** learned policies converge to similar profitability metrics (±10% variance acceptable)

### User Story 2 - Backtesting Trained Agent on Out-of-Sample Data (Priority: P2)

A trader wants to backtest the trained RL agent on held-out test data to evaluate real-world performance
before deploying to paper trading. The system should replay the agent's learned policy on new market
conditions and generate detailed performance reports showing cumulative returns, drawdowns, and Sharpe ratio.

**Why this priority**: Backtesting is critical for validating generalization. Without it, researchers
cannot distinguish between overfitting and true strategy quality.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by: (1) Splitting data (train/test sets), (2) Loading test set
separately, (3) Running trained agent on test set, (4) Computing performance metrics (return, max drawdown,
Sharpe ratio), (5) Comparing to buy-and-hold baseline.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a trained agent and hold-out test period (e.g., 2024-2025),
   **When** agent executes on test data using learned policy,
   **Then** agent generates trading signals without access to test data during training

2. **Given** agent performance metrics from test set,
   **When** comparing RL strategy to buy-and-hold baseline,
   **Then** risk-adjusted returns (Sharpe ratio) are computed for both strategies

3. **Given** multiple test runs with identical random seed,
   **When** running backtest multiple times,
   **Then** results are deterministic (identical trading signals and returns)

---

### User Story 3 - Hyperparameter Exploration and Model Selection (Priority: P3)

A researcher wants to experiment with different DRL algorithms (PPO, A2C, TD3) and hyperparameter
configurations to find the best performing agent. The system should support switching between algorithms
and tuning reward parameters (e.g., risk aversion weights) while maintaining consistent environment behavior.

**Why this priority**: This enables advanced users to optimize strategy performance. It's important but
not essential for initial system capability.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by: (1) Training agents with different hyperparameters,
(2) Comparing reward curves across runs, (3) Identifying highest Sharpe ratio configuration,
(4) Validating reproducibility with fixed random seed.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** multiple hyperparameter configurations (e.g., learning rate: 1e-3, 1e-4, 1e-5),
   **When** training separate agents with each config on same data,
   **Then** system allows side-by-side comparison of reward curves

2. **Given** a preferred agent (highest Sharpe ratio),
   **When** user saves and loads agent from disk,
   **Then** loaded agent produces identical trading signals on same data

### Edge Cases

- What happens when SPY experiences a circuit breaker (trading halt)? System should handle missing data gracefully.
- How does system handle market gaps (weekends, holidays)? Daily data should skip non-trading days automatically.
- What if historical data contains data quality issues (missing OHLCV, extreme outliers)? System must validate data before training.
- What happens if agent learns to always hold (policy collapse)? System should detect this and warn user.
- How does system handle SPY corporate actions (splits, dividend dates)? Adjusted close prices handle this automatically.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST download SPY daily OHLCV data from a reliable source (Yahoo Finance default) for any date range (minimum: 1 year, tested: 2020-2025)

- **FR-002**: System MUST clean historical data by removing NaN values, handling splits/dividends via adjusted close prices, and validating data continuity (no gaps except non-trading days)

- **FR-003**: System MUST compute technical indicators (SMA, RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands) on cleaned price data and expose them as environment features

- **FR-004**: System MUST provide a Gymnasium-compliant trading environment that accepts discrete actions (0=buy, 1=hold, 2=sell) and returns state, reward, and done signals

- **FR-005**: System MUST compute rewards as log returns (log(P_t / P_{t-1})) at each daily timestep, scaled by position (long/flat) to reflect realized profit/loss

- **FR-006**: System MUST integrate with ElegantRL, Stable-Baselines3, and RLlib agents, allowing seamless algorithm switching (PPO, A2C, TD3, DDPG) via configuration

- **FR-007**: System MUST save trained agent models to disk and restore them without degradation (deterministic loading with same random seed)

- **FR-008**: System MUST support train/test data splitting at a specified date (e.g., train: 2020-2024, test: 2025) and prevent data leakage

- **FR-009**: System MUST compute backtest performance metrics (cumulative return, max drawdown, Sharpe ratio, win rate) for trained agent and buy-and-hold baseline

- **FR-010**: System MUST log all training metrics to TensorBoard and provide callback hooks for monitoring reward convergence during training

- **FR-011**: System MUST allow hyperparameter configuration via `config.py` without requiring code changes (learning rate, episode length, network architecture)

- **FR-012**: System MUST expose environment state as [current_balance, shares_held, SPY_price, technical_indicators, turbulence_index] at each timestep

### Key Entities

- **Market Data**: Daily OHLCV candles for SPY symbol, spanning 2020-2025, with technical indicators (SMA, RSI, MACD) computed from close prices

- **Trading Environment**: Gymnasium-compliant simulator that executes discrete actions in a market, tracks portfolio balance and shares held, computes log-return rewards

- **DRL Agent**: Neural network policy (trained via PPO/A2C/TD3) that maps observed state to action distribution, learns to maximize cumulative log returns

- **Trading Decision**: Tuple of (action, position, log_return) where action ∈ {buy, hold, sell}, position reflects current holdings (1=long, 0=flat), reward is realized daily log return

- **Backtest Result**: Record of agent performance on test data including cumulative return %, max drawdown %, Sharpe ratio, win rate (% days with positive return)

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

- **SC-009**: Hyperparameter Sensitivity: Varying learning rate by 10× (e.g., 1e-4 ↔ 1e-3) changes final Sharpe ratio by ±15% but agent remains profitable

- **SC-010**: Documentation: Complete end-to-end example (Jupyter notebook) demonstrates SPY trading system setup, training, and backtesting for a researcher with basic Python knowledge

## Assumptions

- SPY data is available from Yahoo Finance or Alpaca API without authentication issues for 2020-2025 period
- Daily timeframe provides sufficient signal for learning (hourly/minute data not required for initial implementation)
- Log-return-based rewards are sufficient; more complex reward shaping (Sharpe ratio optimization) deferred to future iterations
- Discrete action space (buy/hold/sell) is adequate; continuous position sizing (e.g., portfolio %) deferred
- Buy and sell actions execute at daily close price without slippage modeling (realistic slippage can be added later)
- Historical SPY data reflects real market conditions without structural breaks; 2020-2025 period chosen to include COVID crisis and post-pandemic recovery
- DRL agents require ≥1 year (252+ trading days) of training data to learn meaningful patterns
- Technical indicators (SMA, RSI, MACD) standardized in `config.py` INDICATORS list are sufficient for agent observation

## Constraints

- Training must complete within computational limits of standard GPU/CPU hardware (no distributed training required for initial MVP)
- No real-time market data or live trading required for v1.0 (backtesting and paper trading deferred)
- System must not use future data (no lookahead bias in any backtest or evaluation)
- Agent must operate on daily frequency without intraday state (daily close prices only)

## Out of Scope (Explicitly Excluded)

- Real-time paper trading with Alpaca (deferred to v2.0)
- Risk management features (stop-loss, position limits) [will be environment variants in future releases]
- Multi-asset portfolio optimization (SPY only for v1.0)
- Factor/sentiment analysis (pure price-based features for v1.0)
- Portfolio rebalancing (single-asset strategy)
