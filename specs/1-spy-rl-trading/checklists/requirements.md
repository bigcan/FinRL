# Specification Quality Checklist: SPY RL Trading System

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-27
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)
**Status**: In Progress

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) - PASS: Spec uses "Gymnasium-compliant", "DRL algorithms" generically; defers "Yahoo Finance default" to implementation
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs - PASS: User stories emphasize strategy development and backtesting (researcher needs)
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders - PARTIAL: Uses domain terms (log return, Sharpe ratio, discrete action) but defines them implicitly; acceptable for fintech audience
- [x] All mandatory sections completed - PASS: User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria, Assumptions, Constraints all present

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain - PASS: Specification is fully determined
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous - PASS: All FR-* requirements specify observable behavior (e.g., "load data without errors", "converge to >5% return")
- [x] Success criteria are measurable - PASS: SC-* criteria include specific metrics (>5% return, â‰¥0.5 Sharpe ratio, <30 min execution)
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic - PASS: Success criteria describe outcomes (profitability, convergence) not implementation (specific optimizer, network size)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined - PASS: 9 acceptance scenarios across 3 user stories cover primary and secondary flows
- [x] Edge cases are identified - PASS: 5 edge cases documented (circuit breaker, data gaps, quality issues, policy collapse, corporate actions)
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded - PASS: Out-of-Scope section explicitly defers v2.0 features (paper trading, risk management, multi-asset)
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified - PASS: 8 assumptions documented (data availability, timeframe sufficiency, reward model); constraints section present

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria - PASS: Each FR-* corresponds to user story acceptance scenario (e.g., FR-001 to US1 scenario 1)
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows - PASS: Training (P1), backtesting (P2), hyperparameter exploration (P3) cover core researcher workflows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria - PASS: SC-001 through SC-010 directly map to FR requirements (e.g., SC-002 validates FR-004/FR-005 reward logic)
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification - PASS: Spec avoids PyTorch, NumPy, specific URLs; allows implementation flexibility

## Notes

- **Status**: All checklist items PASS
- **Readiness**: Specification is complete and ready for `/speckit.clarify` (optional) or `/speckit.plan` (recommended next step)
- **Quality Assessment**: High-quality specification with clear requirements, testable scenarios, and explicit scope boundaries
- **Deferred Items**: Properly categorized under Out-of-Scope (real-time trading, multi-asset portfolio, advanced risk management)
- **Assumptions Validation**: All assumptions are reasonable for v1.0 MVP (can revisit in future iterations)

**Approved by**: Claude Code Specification Engine
**Date**: 2025-10-27
**Recommendation**: Proceed to `/speckit.plan` to generate implementation design
